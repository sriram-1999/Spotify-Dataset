Spotify Data Science Capstone Project

Overview

This project, developed as the culmination of the "Introduction to Data Science" course, applies comprehensive data science techniques to analyze a dataset of 52,000 songs from Spotify. The goal is to uncover insights into what makes music popular and identify the characteristics that define various genres.

Objectives

Popularity Analysis: Determine the relationship between song features (e.g., duration, explicitness) and their popularity.
Genre Classification: Utilize audio features to classify songs into genres.
Recommendation System: Develop a personalized recommendation system for users based on song popularity and user feedback.
Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
PCA for dimensionality reduction
Logistic Regression and SVM for classification
Neural Networks for genre prediction
Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Key Findings

Song Popularity: Identified a negative correlation between song length and popularity, with shorter songs tending to be more popular.
Explicit Content: Explicit songs are not necessarily more popular than non-explicit ones.
Major vs. Minor Keys: Songs in a major key are slightly more popular than those in a minor key.
Feature Importance: Danceability and energy are significant predictors of a song's popularity.
Challenges Faced

Handling missing data and skewed distributions.
Balancing specificity and generality in model training to avoid overfitting.
Implementing cross-validation techniques for robust model evaluation.
Contributions

Data Preprocessing: Applied various techniques for data cleaning, handling missing values, and data transformation.
Model Development: Built and fine-tuned models to analyze song popularity and genre classification.
Analysis and Reporting: Conducted thorough analysis to answer research questions and documented findings with visualizations.
